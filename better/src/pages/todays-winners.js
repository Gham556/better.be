//Todays Winners Page//

//This page will be both a scoreboard for the current competition, and a home for the winning posts once scores are finalized. 

//While the competition is running the scoreboard will be rendered with just names, profile pictures, and scores. 

//Once the competition is completed the page will change to add previews of the winning posts alongside the winners and show the rest of the scoreboard below. 
    //Scoreboard length will need to be cut off
    //should always add user to bottom of the board with their score regardless of where they placed (unless they made it to a spot on the rendered positions//

// Function for loading player scores
    /* const findScores = () => {
        //makes api call to data base on page load that updates and renders the top scores//
    };    
    */

//Once a new competition is started this page should be copied and added to an archive of previous competitions that players can look through//
