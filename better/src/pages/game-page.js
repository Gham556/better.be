//Play Game Page//

//import data from api call component//

//The only games I have created in JS use html components which I believe would make it easy to cheat. Will need to find another solution//

//Create and load dynamic game package//
    //The game package will be made up of several game templates into which api data can be inserted//
        //for instance a matching game might load the first_name and last_name of presidents and slot them into the appropriate slots//
    //The game will need to track score and time//

//The game will then thank the player for playing and update their score onto a real-time scoreboard//
