# better.be
//Pre-Development
The Be Better projects attemtps to create a purely merit based social media app. It is intended to be compact and modular, allowing for a long life-span with little upkeep. The app will allow users to create accounts and sign in to complete in daily challenges. The best performing players in each challenge will be allowed to make a single post that everyone on the app will see. This will make moderating content easy as only a few posts will be going up per-day. There will be comments allowed in the post to increase engagment, and possibly for/against comment sections. 

The challenges will be based on a certain topic, and users will be encouraged to post about that topic but not required. The idea being that a meme post winning will encourage people who care about said topic to play harder and make sure real information makes it onto the front page. 

It will need a way to store accounts, session-information, previous winners, winning posts, and comments. It wil need in browser or in app games that dynamically build questions from various api calls. 
There should be a way to add friends and a profile page for each user that tracks performance, and comments. 

*Considerations*
-forcing players to submit a link to an existing web post instead of allowing them to write their own would cut down on concerns of plagerism and overall improve the quality of posts. (or maybe only letting the top scorer type their own would be interesting)
-cheating is going to be a massive issue to deal with especially in browser
-if possible it might be best to make it app only, but only if browser is unrealistic
-Is it best to have a single competition with static winners or, a dynamic competition where winners and posts can change within a certain time limit. 

Site will be built using Gatsby and hosted with Netlify for personal preference. I plan on using SAAS for anything I can to improve site spead and modularity incase the projext is redeveloped with different tools.
